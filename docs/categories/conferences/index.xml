      <description>Location What it was like being in Brussles for a conference:
Nick
Brussels and Belgium are located about as conveniently in Europe as one could hope. Bordered by the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Luxembourg and just short train ride from all of them, one couldnâ€™t ask for a better location. This centrality seemed to enable lots of people to attended that might not otherwise have. Due to this and the fact that all other countries seem to have realized Americans wont learn their languages and thus have learned English enabled me personally to interact with people from all over.</description>

Stefanie kicked the conference off with ice breakers, where we explored topics ranging from #rcatladies &amp;amp; #rdogfellas âŠ•for the record, Iâ€™m an #rchickenlady, ITâ€™S HAPPENING to impostor syndrome. It was an excellent way to get conversations starting!
