      <description>We both recently attended useR!2017 in Brussels. It was a blast to say the least. We‚Äôre going to tag team to cover our favorite things &amp;amp; the lessons we learned while adventuring across the Atlantic.

Stefanie kicked the conference off with ice breakers, where we explored topics ranging from #rcatladies &amp;amp; #rdogfellas ‚äïfor the record, I‚Äôm an #rchickenlady, IT‚ÄôS HAPPENING to impostor syndrome. It was an excellent way to get conversations starting!
