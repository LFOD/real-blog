      <description>TLDR: I made a thing that moves and has sliders and stuff. It‚Äôs down here.
Currently I am taking a class titled ‚ÄúAdvanced Statistical Computing‚Äù taught here at Vanderbilt by Chris Fonnesbeck. The class is a fantastic whirlwind tour so far of some common optimization algorithms used in statistical computing. One of the algorithms I have found particularly fascinating is the ‚Äúsimulated annealing‚Äù algorithm. ‚äïThe whole algorithm is explained much better than I can do in the freely available Jupyter notebook for the lecture.</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of the Poisson distribution, there‚Äôs something about its simplicity and elegance (I really like \(\lambda\)s) that makes it way easier to deal with than some monstrosity like the gamma or normal distribution.
Another thing I am a big fan of is the book I am currently reading: Surely You‚Äôre Joking, Mr Feynman. In one of the chapters, Dr.¬†Feynman discusses his interest in the power series expansion of \(e^x\), and how efficient it is.</description>

      <description>One day Lucy was sitting around on twitter when she spotted this tweet:
I built a ‚Äútinder for academic preprints‚Äù web app: https://t.co/fZYlgkn4WL for @biorxivpreprint preprints. ‚Äî Jeff Leek (@jtleek) October 3, 2016   A tinder for preprints needs swiping though‚Ä¶
Hilarious üòÇ If only it was compatible with swiping..the tactile enjoyment of making snap judgments by swiping left/right is unrivaled #papr https://t.co/isg5hmsh7n ‚Äî Lucy (@LucyStats) October 3, 2016   Soon she remembered that I know a bit of javascript‚Ä¶</description>

      <description>I happened to stumble upon the preview release page for RStudio recently and noticed something that made me exorbitantly happy.
 A preview release of RStudio v1.0.136 is now available for testing and feedback. This release includes‚Ä¶ Support for JavaScript and CSS chunks in R Notebooks‚Ä¶
 ‚ÄúSupport for JavaScript and CSS chunks in R Notebooks‚Äù! As someone who loves using javascript for plotting (and secretly for manipulating) data this is massively exciting.</description>
