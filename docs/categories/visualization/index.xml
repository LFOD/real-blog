      <description>Motivation Recently I was pointed in the direction of a post titled Visualizing Regression on the blog of the popular data-visualization practitioner Stephanie Evergreen (although it is a guest post and not written by Stephanie). In it the authors point out the fact that common regression tables are an all around bad way of reporting the results of a regression. While I whole heartedly agree with the premise there were a few rather large mistakes in the interpretations behind the regression output.</description>
