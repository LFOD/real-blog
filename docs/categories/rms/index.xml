      <description>This is a tale of the dire type 1 error consequences that occur when you test for linearity.
 Edvard Munch‚Äôs The Scream (1893), coincidentally also the face Frank Harrell makes when he sees students testing for linearity. First, my favorite explanation of type 1 error üê∫:

      <description>Frank Harrell teaches an amazing course ‚ÄúRegression Modeling Strategies‚Äù based on his book each spring at Vanderbilt.
This was one of my all time favorite courses. It has just the right amount of practical strategies, brilliant statistical insight, and zealous disdain for all things stepwise regression. In fact, Frank‚Äôs valiant fight against dichotomization inspired the name of this very blog.
This semester, Nick is enrolled in the course, and I will be TAing it, so we thought it would be a perfect time to do what all good 21st century students do, blog about it.</description>
