      <description>I am a big fan of the Poisson distribution, so much in fact I even have it tatooed on my arm.
Finally did it. Guess im stuck with this statistics thing now. #poissonPmf pic.twitter.com/DtTPzOiErd — Nick Strayer (@NicholasStrayer) August 19, 2017   Another thing I am a big fan of the book I am currently reading: Surely You’re Joking, Mr Feynman. In a recent chapter Dr. Feynman discusses his like of the power series expansion of \(e^x\), and how efficient it is.</description>

      <description>Setup Recently, there seems to have been an uptick in citations of studies or statistics about this or that in the news and on the internet. As a statistician I think this is great. Anytime we can start to bring objectivity into our assessments of situations it’s fantastic. ⊕This is not to say all data/ stats are objective. Very frequently they can be very dangerously not so. However, I have also noticed some incorrect conclusions being drawn on the basis of these statistics.</description>
