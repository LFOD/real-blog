      <description>HAPPY world emoji day! üåç üêî üìÜ
In honor of this momentous occasion, I have decided to analyze the emojis used on rOpenSci‚Äôs Slack.
library(&amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;) ‚äïIf you‚Äôd like to follow along, go fetch yourself a Slack token.
token &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;MY_SLACK_API_TOKEN&amp;quot; ## stick your token here We will first use Slack‚Äôs reactions.list method.
‚äïNotice here I am pulling the items from the response and then from each item I am interested in the message reactions.</description>

      <description>I had such a delightful time at rOpenSci‚Äôs unconference last week. ‚äï21 üì¶ were produced! Not only was it extremely productive, but in between the crazy productivity was some epic community building.
Stefanie kicked the conference off with ice breakers, where we explored topics ranging from #rcatladies &amp;amp; #rdogfellas ‚äïfor the record, I‚Äôm an #rchickenlady, IT‚ÄôS HAPPENING to impostor syndrome. It was an excellent way to get conversations starting!

I pulled the iTunes API for the term drunk in podcasts &amp;amp; plotted the results over time. I also finally found an excuse to use emoGG.
