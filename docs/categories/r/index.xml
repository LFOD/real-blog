      <description>We both recently attended useR!2017 in Brussels. It was a blast to say the least. We‚Äôre going to tag team to cover our favorite things &amp;amp; the lessons we learned while adventuring across the Atlantic.
Location Lucy: Brussels was incredible. The üç∫ was delectable and the people were delightful. ‚äïThis proved to be particularly useful when we temporarly misplaced our travel buddy Jacquelyn on our way from the ‚úàÔ∏è - we convinently followed the signs to wifi!</description>
