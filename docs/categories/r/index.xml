      <description>This post will serve as a quick tutorial getting you from nothing to a customized blogdown blog using the theme built for this blog: tuftesque.
The tuftesque theme gives your blog a ‚Ä¶tufte-esque‚Ä¶ style that eschues some of the choices of the original and which I‚Äôve added a few splashes of my personal style. The main title page is a single column and has an easily customizable banner where as the article view is the two panel view (for large screens) to allow for sidenotes.</description>

      <description>We both recently attended useR!2017 in Brussels. It was a blast to say the least. We‚Äôre going to tag team to cover our favorite things &amp;amp; the lessons we learned while adventuring across the Atlantic.
Location Lucy: Brussels was incredible. The üç∫ was delectable and the people were delightful. ‚äïThis proved to be particularly useful when we temporarly misplaced our travel buddy Jacquelyn on our way from the ‚úàÔ∏è - we convinently followed the signs to wifi!</description>
