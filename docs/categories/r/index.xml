      <description>It’s grown slowly into its own overOur blog’s theme started as ‘hugo-tufte’ but has overtime been customized to the point it’s distinctly different. I’ve been asked to put it up as a standalone theme for other to use, here it is! This post will serve as a quick tutorial getting you from nothing to a customized blogdown blog using the theme built for this blog: tuftesque. It doesn’t cover the more standard details such as writing new posts as I feel those have been covered much better than I could here.</description>

      <description>We both recently attended useR!2017 in Brussels. It was a blast to say the least. We’re going to tag team to cover our favorite things &amp;amp; the lessons we learned while adventuring across the Atlantic.
Location Lucy: Brussels was incredible. The 🍺 was delectable and the people were delightful. ⊕This proved to be particularly useful when we temporarly misplaced our travel buddy Jacquelyn on our way from the ✈️ - we convinently followed the signs to wifi!</description>
