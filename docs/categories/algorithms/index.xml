      <description>TLDR: I made a thing that moves and has sliders and stuff. It’s down here.
Currently I am taking a class titled “Advanced Statistical Computing” taught here at Vanderbilt by Chris Fonnesbeck. The class is a fantastic whirlwind tour so far of some common optimization algorithms used in statistical computing. One of the algorithms I have found particularly fascinating is the “simulated annealing” algorithm. ⊕The whole algorithm is explained much better than I can do in the freely available Jupyter notebook for the lecture.</description>
