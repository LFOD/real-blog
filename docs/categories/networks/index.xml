      <description>What is network3d? network3d is a tiny R package built using the htmlwidgets package that takes network data in the form of a node and edge dataframes and performs a physics simulation to determine the optimal layout in three dimensions. There is a lot of customization you can do but attempts have been made to make it as simple to use as possible.</description>
