      <description>My husband’s family throws a family reunion every year and this year we’ve been tasked with co-planning it. We were trying to decide on the best location for everyone, so I embarked on a mission to find the center of all of our residences.
library(tidyverse) library(leaflet) Geocoding the locations I began by putting together a quick .csv of the locations and number of family members in each.</description>

      <description>I always love discussions about R release names and their origin. I have been working on this list for a while – with the release of “Short Summer” today, I thought it’d be a good time to post!
All of the release names are references to Peanuts strips/films. I think this is just so delightful! A few months ago, I attempted to get permission to embed the strips on our blog, but unfortunately it was denied (unless with a limited audience and password protection 🤷‍♀), so I’ve just linked to the comics – Enjoy!</description>

🎁 gifts are exchanged at a party
🤔 the receiver is tasked with guessing who the gift-giver was!

      <description>Background I didn’t expect many people to use the you-draw-it charts (henceforth referred to as ‘drawrs’) I put into my shiny modules package shinysense but a decent number did, and with that usage came… bugs.
In an effort to fix the bugs I went back and tore the function down and re-wrote it entirely. This time I utilized the javascript and R development knowledge I gained from building it the first time ’round.</description>

      <description>Last March Maëlle wrote a blog post “Faces of #rstats Twitter”, a great tutorial on scraping twitter photos and compiling them in a collage. This inspired a similar adventure, but for #RLadies!
 One of our early brainstorm ideas, as Maëlle pointed out, looks a bit more like a kniting pattern. 
We brainstormed different ways we could make this collage unique, but ultimilately landed on creating a mosaic with the R-Ladies logo.</description>

      <description>This post will serve as a quick tutorial getting you from nothing to a customized blogdown blog using the theme built for this blog: tuftesque.
The tuftesque theme gives your blog a …tufte-esque… style that eschues some of the choices of the original and which I’ve added a few splashes of my personal style. The main title page is a single column and has an easily customizable banner where as the article view is the two panel view (for large screens) to allow for sidenotes.</description>

      <description>Frank Harrell teaches an amazing course “Regression Modeling Strategies” based on his book each spring at Vanderbilt.
This was one of my all time favorite courses. It has just the right amount of practical strategies, brilliant statistical insight, and zealous disdain for all things stepwise regression. In fact, Frank’s valiant fight against dichotomization inspired the name of this very blog.
This semester, Nick is enrolled in the course, and I will be TAing it, so we thought it would be a perfect time to do what all good 21st century students do, blog about it.</description>
