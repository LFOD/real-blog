      <description>I had such a delightful time at rOpenSci’s unconference last week. ⊕21 📦 were produced! Not only was it extremely productive, but in between the crazy productivity was some epic community building.
Stefanie kicked the conference off with ice breakers, where we explored topics ranging from #rcatladies &amp;amp; #rdogfellas ⊕for the record, I’m an #rchickenlady, IT’S HAPPENING to impostor syndrome. It was an excellent way to get conversations starting!

      <description>This is a tale of the dire type 1 error consequences that occur when you test for linearity.
 Edvard Munch’s The Scream (1893), coincidentally also the face Frank Harrell makes when he sees students testing for linearity. First, my favorite explanation of type 1 error 🐺:
 @jgschraiber @eagereyes Pro-tip that changed my life: in The Boy Who Cried Wolf, the villagers first make a Type 1, and then a Type 2 error.</description>

      <description>For today’s rendition of I am curious about everything, in Hilary Parker &amp;amp; Roger Peng’s Not So Standard Deviations Episode 32, Roger suggested the prevalence of drunk podcasting has dramatically increased - so I thought I’d dig into it 🚧👷.
I pulled the iTunes API for the term drunk in podcasts &amp;amp; plotted the results over time. I also finally found an excuse to use emoGG.

      <description>Lara Harmon has put in countless hours to build and uplift the ASA Student community. We are SO grateful. We know she loves cats, as evidenced by

      <title>Regression modeling strategies: a student&#39;s perspective</title>

      <description>Frank Harrell teaches an amazing course “Regression Modeling Strategies” based on his book each spring at Vanderbilt.
This was one of my all time favorite courses. It has just the right amount of practical strategies, brilliant statistical insight, and zealous disdain for all things stepwise regression. In fact, Frank’s valiant fight against dichotomization inspired the name of this very blog.
This semester, Nick is enrolled in the course, and I will be TAing it, so we thought it would be a perfect time to do what all good 21st century students do, blog about it.</description>

      <description>It’s that post-holiday time of year to write some thank yous! I’m getting excited to attend rstudio::conf next week, so in that spirit, I have put together a little thank you using dplyr.
require(dplyr) dear &amp;lt;-function(input, you=&amp;quot;you&amp;quot;){ cat(input, &amp;quot;\nDear &amp;quot;, you,&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;, sep = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;) } thank_you &amp;lt;- function(input, for_the = &amp;quot;gift&amp;quot;){ cat(input, &amp;quot;\n Thank you for the&amp;quot;, for_the) } personal_touch &amp;lt;- function(input, from_the_heart = &amp;quot;I hope you have a lovely New Year!</description>
