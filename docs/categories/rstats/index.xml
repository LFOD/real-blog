      <description>HAPPY world emoji day! üåç üêî üìÜ
In honor of this momentous occasion, I have decided to analyze the emojis used on rOpenSci‚Äôs Slack.
library(&amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;) ‚äïIf you‚Äôd like to follow along, go fetch yourself a Slack token.
token &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;MY_SLACK_API_TOKEN&amp;quot; ## stick your token here We will first use Slack‚Äôs reactions.list method.
‚äïNotice here I am pulling the items from the response and then from each item I am interested in the message reactions.</description>

      <description>This post will serve as a quick tutorial getting you from nothing to a customized blogdown blog using the theme built for this blog: tuftesque.
The tuftesque theme gives your blog a ‚Ä¶tufte-esque‚Ä¶ style that eschues some of the choices of the original and which I‚Äôve added a few splashes of my personal style. The main title page is a single column and has an easily customizable banner where as the article view is the two panel view (for large screens) to allow for sidenotes.</description>

      <description>We both recently attended useR!2017 in Brussels. It was a blast to say the least. We‚Äôre going to tag team to cover our favorite things &amp;amp; the lessons we learned while adventuring across the Atlantic.
Location Lucy: Brussels was incredible. The üç∫ was delectable and the people were delightful. ‚äïThis proved to be particularly useful when we temporarly misplaced our travel buddy Jacquelyn on our way from the ‚úàÔ∏è - we convinently followed the signs to wifi!</description>

      <description>I had such a delightful time at rOpenSci‚Äôs unconference last week. ‚äï21 üì¶ were produced! Not only was it extremely productive, but in between the crazy productivity was some epic community building.
Stefanie kicked the conference off with ice breakers, where we explored topics ranging from #rcatladies &amp;amp; #rdogfellas ‚äïfor the record, I‚Äôm an #rchickenlady, IT‚ÄôS HAPPENING to impostor syndrome. It was an excellent way to get conversations starting!

      <description>I had an absolutely delightful time at ENAR this year. Lots of talk about the intersection between data science &amp;amp; statistics, diversity, and exceptional advancements in statistical methods.
&#34;By a small sample we may judge of the whole piece&#34; -- -- I loved it, but let‚Äôs see what others were saying! Check out this word cloud of the most commonly tweeted words.
This certainly sums up my experience.</description>

      <description>This is a tale of the dire type 1 error consequences that occur when you test for linearity.
 Edvard Munch‚Äôs The Scream (1893), coincidentally also the face Frank Harrell makes when he sees students testing for linearity. First, my favorite explanation of type 1 error üê∫:

      <description>For today‚Äôs rendition of I am curious about everything, in Hilary Parker &amp;amp; Roger Peng‚Äôs Not So Standard Deviations Episode 32, Roger suggested the prevalence of drunk podcasting has dramatically increased - so I thought I‚Äôd dig into it üößüë∑.
I pulled the iTunes API for the term drunk in podcasts &amp;amp; plotted the results over time. I also finally found an excuse to use emoGG.

      <description>Frank Harrell teaches an amazing course ‚ÄúRegression Modeling Strategies‚Äù based on his book each spring at Vanderbilt.
This was one of my all time favorite courses. It has just the right amount of practical strategies, brilliant statistical insight, and zealous disdain for all things stepwise regression. In fact, Frank‚Äôs valiant fight against dichotomization inspired the name of this very blog.
This semester, Nick is enrolled in the course, and I will be TAing it, so we thought it would be a perfect time to do what all good 21st century students do, blog about it.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs that post-holiday time of year to write some thank yous! I‚Äôm getting excited to attend rstudio::conf next week, so in that spirit, I have put together a little thank you using dplyr.
