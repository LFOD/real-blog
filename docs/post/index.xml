      <description>A little over a week ago, Hilary Parker tweeted out a poll about sending calendar invites that generated quite the repartee.
Do you like getting google calendar invites from your friends for lunches / coffees / etc.? ‚Äî Hilary Parker (@hspter) July 19, 2017   It was quite popular üíÖ ‚Äì so much so that I couldn‚Äôt possible keep up with all of the replies!</description>

      <description>Last March Ma√´lle wrote a blog post ‚ÄúFaces of #rstats Twitter‚Äù, a great tutorial on scraping twitter photos and compiling them in a collage. This inspired a similar adventure, but for #RLadies!
 One of our early brainstorm ideas, as Ma√´lle pointed out, looks a bit more like a kniting pattern. 
We brainstormed different ways we could make this collage unique, but ultimilately landed on creating a mosaic with the R-Ladies logo.</description>

      <description>HAPPY world emoji day! üåç üêî üìÜ
In honor of this momentous occasion, I have decided to analyze the emojis used on rOpenSci‚Äôs Slack.

      <description>This post will serve as a quick tutorial getting you from nothing to a customized blogdown blog using the theme built for this blog: tuftesque.
The tuftesque theme gives your blog a ‚Ä¶tufte-esque‚Ä¶ style that eschues some of the choices of the original and which I‚Äôve added a few splashes of my personal style. The main title page is a single column and has an easily customizable banner where as the article view is the two panel view (for large screens) to allow for sidenotes.</description>

      <description>I had such a delightful time at rOpenSci‚Äôs unconference last week. ‚äï21 üì¶ were produced! Not only was it extremely productive, but in between the crazy productivity was some epic community building.
Stefanie kicked the conference off with ice breakers, where we explored topics ranging from #rcatladies &amp;amp; #rdogfellas ‚äïfor the record, I‚Äôm an #rchickenlady, IT‚ÄôS HAPPENING to impostor syndrome. It was an excellent way to get conversations starting!

      <description>Why The Problem You are working in a collaborative situation working on some form of analysis. You want to produce a nice looking document of your work at the end and have easy contribution from all sources.
 The Solutions Sit in one room and have one person write up all your work as you do it
Problems:
 source Use github with branches and pull requests.
Problems:
 Requires groupmates to all get second PhD in git.</description>

I pulled the iTunes API for the term drunk in podcasts &amp;amp; plotted the results over time. I also finally found an excuse to use emoGG.

      <description>A New Year‚Äôs resolution for all of our models: get more flexible!
As an aside, I‚Äôm better at implementing yoga for my models than yoga for myself, most of the time I end up like this:
 Anyways, let‚Äôs make our models flexible! By flexible, we mean let‚Äôs be more intentional about fitting nonlinear parametric models.
What do you mean by nonlinear modeling By nonlinear modeling, we mean fitting parametric models with nonlinear terms.</description>

      <description>Frank Harrell teaches an amazing course ‚ÄúRegression Modeling Strategies‚Äù based on his book each spring at Vanderbilt.
This was one of my all time favorite courses. It has just the right amount of practical strategies, brilliant statistical insight, and zealous disdain for all things stepwise regression. In fact, Frank‚Äôs valiant fight against dichotomization inspired the name of this very blog.
This semester, Nick is enrolled in the course, and I will be TAing it, so we thought it would be a perfect time to do what all good 21st century students do, blog about it.</description>

      <description>Frequently, and especially recently, misunderstandings of common statistical terms/ concepts have caused confusion and even anger. I would like to (attempt) to clear up a big player in the world of commonly used (and commonly misunderstood) statistical concepts: the p-value.
  Stealing Lucy D‚ÄôAgostino McGowan‚Äôs XKCD embedding strategy. TL DR A p-value is not a probability of the true parameter being something, but the percentage of times that the data you saw, or more extreme data, would occur given some ‚Äúnull‚Äù model.</description>

      <description>This was inspired by Hilary Parker &amp;amp; Roger Peng‚Äôs Not So Standard Deviations Episode 28, which can be found here. It was suggested that it would be useful to lay out Hill‚Äôs criterion for data scientists, I agree!

[causation: An event or outcome B is influenced by a change in A]

Sir Austin Bradford Hill, a statistician and epidemiologist, created a list of guidelines for evaluating whether there is evidence of a causal relationship.</description>
