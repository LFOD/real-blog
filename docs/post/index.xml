      <description>Location What it was like being in Brussles for a conference:
Nick
Brussels and Belgium are located about as conveniently in Europe as one could hope. Bordered by the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Luxemburg and just short train ride from all of them, one couldn‚Äôt ask for a better location. This centrality seemed to enable lots of people to attended that might not otherwise have. Dueo to this and the fact that all other countries seem to have realized Americans wont learn their languages and thus have learned English enabled me personally to interact with people from all over.</description>

      <description>I had such a delightful time at rOpenSci‚Äôs unconference last week. ‚äï21 üì¶ were produced! Not only was it extremely productive, but in between the crazy productivity was some epic community building.
Stefanie kicked the conference off with ice breakers, where we explored topics ranging from #rcatladies &amp;amp; #rdogfellas ‚äïfor the record, I‚Äôm an #rchickenlady, IT‚ÄôS HAPPENING to impostor syndrome. It was an excellent way to get conversations starting!

      <description>I had an absolutely delightful time at ENAR this year. Lots of talk about the intersection between data science &amp;amp; statistics, diversity, and exceptional advancements in statistical methods.
&#34;By a small sample we may judge of the whole piece&#34; -- -- I loved it, but let‚Äôs see what others were saying! Check out this word cloud of the most commonly tweeted words.
This certainly sums up my experience.</description>

      <description>Why The Problem You are working in a collaborative situation working on some form of analysis. You want to produce a nice looking document of your work at the end and have easy contribution from all sources.
 The Solutions Sit in one room and have one person write up all your work as you do it
Problems:
 source Use github with branches and pull requests.
Problems:
 Requires groupmates to all get second PhD in git.</description>

      <description>This is a tale of the dire type 1 error consequences that occur when you test for linearity.

      <description>For today‚Äôs rendition of I am curious about everything, in Hilary Parker &amp;amp; Roger Peng‚Äôs Not So Standard Deviations Episode 32, Roger suggested the prevalence of drunk podcasting has dramatically increased - so I thought I‚Äôd dig into it üößüë∑.
I pulled the iTunes API for the term drunk in podcasts &amp;amp; plotted the results over time. I also finally found an excuse to use emoGG.

      <description>A New Year‚Äôs resolution for all of our models: get more flexible!
As an aside, I‚Äôm better at implementing yoga for my models than yoga for myself, most of the time I end up like this:
 Anyways, let‚Äôs make our models flexible! By flexible, we mean let‚Äôs be more intentional about fitting nonlinear parametric models.
What do you mean by nonlinear modeling By nonlinear modeling, we mean fitting parametric models with nonlinear terms.</description>

      <description>I happened to stumble upon the preview release page for RStudio recently and noticed something that made me exorbitantly happy.
 A preview release of RStudio v1.0.136 is now available for testing and feedback. This release includes‚Ä¶ Support for JavaScript and CSS chunks in R Notebooks‚Ä¶
 ‚ÄúSupport for JavaScript and CSS chunks in R Notebooks‚Äù! As someone who loves using javascript for plotting (and secretly for manipulating) data this is massively exciting.</description>

      <description>Frank Harrell teaches an amazing course ‚ÄúRegression Modeling Strategies‚Äù based on his book each spring at Vanderbilt.
This was one of my all time favorite courses. It has just the right amount of practical strategies, brilliant statistical insight, and zealous disdain for all things stepwise regression. In fact, Frank‚Äôs valiant fight against dichotomization inspired the name of this very blog.
This semester, Nick is enrolled in the course, and I will be TAing it, so we thought it would be a perfect time to do what all good 21st century students do, blog about it.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs that post-holiday time of year to write some thank yous! I‚Äôm getting excited to attend rstudio::conf next week, so in that spirit, I have put together a little thank you using dplyr.

      <description>Frequently, and especially recently, misunderstandings of common statistical terms/ concepts have caused confusion and even anger. I would like to (attempt) to clear up a big player in the world of commonly used (and commonly misunderstood) statistical concepts: the p-value.
  Stealing Lucy D‚ÄôAgostino McGowan‚Äôs XKCD embedding strategy. TL DR A p-value is not a probability of the true parameter being something, but the percentage of times that the data you saw, or more extreme data, would occur given some ‚Äúnull‚Äù model.</description>

      <description>This was inspired by Hilary Parker &amp;amp; Roger Peng‚Äôs Not So Standard Deviations Episode 28, which can be found here. It was suggested that it would be useful to lay out Hill‚Äôs criterion for data scientists, I agree!

[causation: An event or outcome B is influenced by a change in A]

Sir Austin Bradford Hill, a statistician and epidemiologist, created a list of guidelines for evaluating whether there is evidence of a causal relationship.</description>
