      <description>TLDR: I made a thing that moves and has sliders and stuff. It‚Äôs down here.
Currently I am taking a class titled ‚ÄúAdvanced Statistical Computing‚Äù taught here at Vanderbilt by Chris Fonnesbeck. The class is a fantastic whirlwind tour so far of some common optimization algorithms used in statistical computing. One of the algorithms I have found particularly fascinating is the ‚Äúsimulated annealing‚Äù algorithm. ‚äïThe whole algorithm is explained much better than I can do in the freely available Jupyter notebook for the lecture.</description>

      <description>A recent paper, Redefine Statistical Significance by 72 (üò±) co-authors, has caused quite a stir in the statistical community. Our student-run journal club at Vanderbilt will be discussing this contribution at our meeting led by Nathan James this week, so I‚Äôve attempted to create a list of significant responses/commentary that have come out since this paper was posted on PsyArXiv.
This was compiled mostly via a quick Twitter search - please let me know what we are missing!</description>

      <title>A Simple Slack Bot With Plumber</title>

      <description>Intro To Plumber Plumber is an R package that allows you to create web apis in R. This is fantastic because it allows you to take your R code (models, database access, etc) and make them easy to access from anything capable of making http requests. This means a data scientist working at a tech company who has developed a fancy model using all of the tools at R‚Äôs disposal can make it available to their company‚Äôs app without needing to have a team of engineers port the model to whatever language the company uses for their back-end.</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of the Poisson distribution, there‚Äôs something about its simplicity and elegance (I really like \(\lambda\)s) that makes it way easier to deal with than some monstrosity like the gamma or normal distribution.
Another thing I am a big fan of is the book I am currently reading: Surely You‚Äôre Joking, Mr Feynman. In one of the chapters, Dr.¬†Feynman discusses his interest in the power series expansion of \(e^x\), and how efficient it is.</description>

      <description>Setup Recently, there seems to have been an uptick in citations of studies or statistics about this or that in the news and on the internet. As a statistician I think this is great. Anytime we can start to bring objectivity into our assessments of situations it‚Äôs fantastic. ‚äïThis is not to say all data/ stats are objective. Very frequently they can be very dangerously not so. However, I have also noticed some incorrect conclusions being drawn on the basis of these statistics.</description>

In an effort to fix the bugs I went back and tore the function down and re-wrote it entirely. This time I utilized the javascript and R development knowledge I gained from building it the first time ‚Äôround.</description>

      <description>Last March Ma√´lle wrote a blog post ‚ÄúFaces of #rstats Twitter‚Äù, a great tutorial on scraping twitter photos and compiling them in a collage. This inspired a similar adventure, but for #RLadies!
 One of our early brainstorm ideas, as Ma√´lle pointed out, looks a bit more like a kniting pattern. 
We brainstormed different ways we could make this collage unique, but ultimilately landed on creating a mosaic with the R-Ladies logo.</description>

      <description>This post will serve as a quick tutorial getting you from nothing to a customized blogdown blog using the theme built for this blog: tuftesque.
The tuftesque theme gives your blog a ‚Ä¶tufte-esque‚Ä¶ style that eschues some of the choices of the original and which I‚Äôve added a few splashes of my personal style. The main title page is a single column and has an easily customizable banner where as the article view is the two panel view (for large screens) to allow for sidenotes.</description>

This was one of my all time favorite courses. It has just the right amount of practical strategies, brilliant statistical insight, and zealous disdain for all things stepwise regression. In fact, Frank‚Äôs valiant fight against dichotomization inspired the name of this very blog.
This semester, Nick is enrolled in the course, and I will be TAing it, so we thought it would be a perfect time to do what all good 21st century students do, blog about it.</description>
