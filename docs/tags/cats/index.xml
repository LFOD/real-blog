      <description>Intro To Plumber Plumber is an R package that allows you to create web apis in R. This is fantastic because it allows you to take your R code (models, database access, etc) and make them easy to access from anything capable of making http requests. This means a data scientist working at a tech company who has developed a fancy model using all of the tools at R’s disposal can make it available to their company’s app without needing to have a team of engineers port the model to whatever language the company uses for their back-end.</description>
