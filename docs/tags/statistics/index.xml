      <description>I am a big fan of the Poisson distribution, there’s something about its simplicity and elegance (I really like \(\lambda\)s) that makes it way easier to deal with than some monstrosity like the gamma or normal distribution.
Another thing I am a big fan of is the book I am currently reading: Surely You’re Joking, Mr Feynman. In one of the chapters, Dr. Feynman discusses his interest in the power series expansion of \(e^x\), and how efficient it is.</description>

      <description>Setup Recently, there seems to have been an uptick in citations of studies or statistics about this or that in the news and on the internet. As a statistician I think this is great. Anytime we can start to bring objectivity into our assessments of situations it’s fantastic. ⊕This is not to say all data/ stats are objective. Very frequently they can be very dangerously not so. However, I have also noticed some incorrect conclusions being drawn on the basis of these statistics.</description>
