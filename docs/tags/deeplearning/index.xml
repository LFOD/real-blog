      <description>Motivation My package shinysense has been around for more than a year now. It started as a package to add swiping via touch screens to shiny for our app Papr, but then slowly got built to include functions for hearing (shinyearr), movement (shinymovr), and drawing (shinydrawr). However one major sense was missing: vision.
I had it on the to-do list for the package for a while but never got around to it.</description>
