      <description>It’s grown slowly into its own overOur blog’s theme started as ‘hugo-tufte’ but has overtime been customized to the point it’s distinctly different. I’ve been asked to put it up as a standalone theme for other to use, here it is! This post will serve as a quick tutorial getting you from nothing to a customized blogdown blog using the theme built for this blog: tuftesque. It doesn’t cover the more standard details such as writing new posts as I feel those have been covered much better than I could here.</description>
