      <description>Motivation My package shinysense has been around for more than a year now. It started as a package to add swiping via touch screens to shiny for our app Papr, but then slowly got built to include functions for hearing (shinyearr), movement (shinymovr), and drawing (shinydrawr). However one major sense was missing: vision.
I had it on the to-do list for the package for a while but never got around to it.</description>

      <description>Background I didn’t expect many people to use the you-draw-it charts (henceforth referred to as ‘drawrs’) I put into my shiny modules package shinysense but a decent number did, and with that usage came… bugs.
In an effort to fix the bugs I went back and tore the function down and re-wrote it entirely. This time I utilized the javascript and R development knowledge I gained from building it the first time ’round.</description>
