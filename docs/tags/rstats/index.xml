      <description>My husband’s family throws a family reunion every year and this year we’ve been tasked with co-planning it. We were trying to decide on the best location for everyone, so I embarked on a mission to find the center of all of our residences.
library(tidyverse) library(leaflet) Geocoding the locations I began by putting together a quick .csv of the locations and number of family members in each.</description>

Pilgrim’s Progress: a journey from confusion to contribution Mara Averick Navigating the data science landscape can be overwhelming. Luckily, you don’t have to do it alone! In fact, I’ll argue shouldn’t do it alone. Whether it be by tweeting your latest mistake, asking a well-formed question, or submitting a pull request to a popular package, you can help others and yourselves by “learning out loud.</description>

      <description>’Tis the season for white elephant / גמד וענק / Yankee swap / secret santa-ing! There are various rules for this, for our version:
🏷 each participant receives the name of someone else to purchase a gift for
🎁 gifts are exchanged at a party
🤔 the receiver is tasked with guessing who the gift-giver was!
We thought it’d be particularly fun to do it #rstats style.
Assigning partners We had our interested classmates sign up on a Google Form,⊕ resulting in a Google Sheet with each participant’s name, email, and interests.</description>

      <description>I always love discussions about R release names and their origin. I have been working on this list for a while – with the release of “Short Summer” today, I thought it’d be a good time to post!
All of the release names are references to Peanuts strips/films. I think this is just so delightful! A few months ago, I attempted to get permission to embed the strips on our blog, but unfortunately it was denied (unless with a limited audience and password protection 🤷‍♀️), so I’ve just linked to the comics – Enjoy!</description>

      <description>Background I didn’t expect many people to use the you-draw-it charts (henceforth referred to as ‘drawrs’) I put into my shiny modules package shinysense but a decent number did, and with that usage came… bugs.
In an effort to fix the bugs I went back and tore the function down and re-wrote it entirely. This time I utilized the javascript and R development knowledge I gained from building it the first time ’round.</description>

      <description>Last March Maëlle wrote a blog post “Faces of #rstats Twitter”, a great tutorial on scraping twitter photos and compiling them in a collage. This inspired a similar adventure, but for #RLadies!
 One of our early brainstorm ideas, as Maëlle pointed out, looks a bit more like a kniting pattern. 
We brainstormed different ways we could make this collage unique, but ultimilately landed on creating a mosaic with the R-Ladies logo.</description>

      <description>This post will serve as a quick tutorial getting you from nothing to a customized blogdown blog using the theme built for this blog: tuftesque.
The tuftesque theme gives your blog a …tufte-esque… style that eschues some of the choices of the original and which I’ve added a few splashes of my personal style. The main title page is a single column and has an easily customizable banner where as the article view is the two panel view (for large screens) to allow for sidenotes.</description>

      <description>A New Year’s resolution for all of our models: get more flexible!
As an aside, I’m better at implementing yoga for my models than yoga for myself, most of the time I end up like this:
 Anyways, let’s make our models flexible! By flexible, we mean let’s be more intentional about fitting nonlinear parametric models.
What do you mean by nonlinear modeling By nonlinear modeling, we mean fitting parametric models with nonlinear terms.</description>
