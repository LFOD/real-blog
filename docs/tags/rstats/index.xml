In honor of this momentous occasion, I have decided to analyze the emojis used on rOpenSci‚Äôs Slack.

‚äïNotice here I am pulling the items from the response and then from each item I am interested in the message reactions.</description>

      <description>I had such a delightful time at rOpenSci‚Äôs unconference last week. ‚äï21 üì¶ were produced! Not only was it extremely productive, but in between the crazy productivity was some epic community building.
Stefanie kicked the conference off with ice breakers, where we explored topics ranging from #rcatladies &amp;amp; #rdogfellas ‚äïfor the record, I‚Äôm an #rchickenlady, IT‚ÄôS HAPPENING to impostor syndrome. It was an excellent way to get conversations starting!

      <description>A New Year‚Äôs resolution for all of our models: get more flexible!
