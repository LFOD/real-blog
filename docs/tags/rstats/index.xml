      <description>I always love discussions about R release names and their origin. I have been working on this list for a while ‚Äì with the source release of ‚ÄúShort Summer‚Äù today, I thought it‚Äôd be a good time to post!
All of the release names are references to Peanuts strips/films. I think this is just so delightful! A few months ago, I attempted to get permission to embed the strips on our blog, but unfortunately it was denied (unless with had a limited audience with password protection ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), so I‚Äôve just linked to the comics ‚Äì Enjoy!</description>

      <description>We‚Äôve updated our R Markdown website tutorial to depend on RStudio for simplicity. You can find our previous version if you would rather not depend on RStudio.
Setup Today, more than ever, a website is like a business card. As a graduate student or academic, by having a nice website you are not only providing a one-stop-shop for all of your necessary information, ‚äïAND you are illustrating that you have the technical prowess to accomplish this!</description>

      <title>New and improved draw charts in shinysense</title>

      <description>Background I didn‚Äôt expect many people to use the you-draw-it charts (henceforth referred to as ‚Äòdrawrs‚Äô) I put into my shiny modules package shinysense but a decent number did, and with that usage came‚Ä¶ bugs.
In an effort to fix the bugs I went back and tore the function down and re-wrote it entirely. This time I utilized the javascript and R development knowledge I gained from building it the first time ‚Äôround.</description>

      <description>A little over a week ago, Hilary Parker tweeted out a poll about sending calendar invites that generated quite the repartee.
Do you like getting google calendar invites from your friends for lunches / coffees / etc.? ‚Äî Hilary Parker (@hspter) July 19, 2017   It was quite popular üíÖ ‚Äì so much so that I couldn‚Äôt possible keep up with all of the replies!</description>

      <description>Last March Ma√´lle wrote a blog post ‚ÄúFaces of #rstats Twitter‚Äù, a great tutorial on scraping twitter photos and compiling them in a collage. This inspired a similar adventure, but for #RLadies!
 One of our early brainstorm ideas, as Ma√´lle pointed out, looks a bit more like a kniting pattern. 
We brainstormed different ways we could make this collage unique, but ultimilately landed on creating a mosaic with the R-Ladies logo.</description>

token &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;MY_SLACK_API_TOKEN&amp;quot; ## stick your token here We will first use Slack‚Äôs reactions.list method.
‚äïNotice here I am pulling the items from the response and then from each item I am interested in the message reactions.</description>

      <description>This post will serve as a quick tutorial getting you from nothing to a customized blogdown blog using the theme built for this blog: tuftesque.
The tuftesque theme gives your blog a ‚Ä¶tufte-esque‚Ä¶ style that eschues some of the choices of the original and which I‚Äôve added a few splashes of my personal style. The main title page is a single column and has an easily customizable banner where as the article view is the two panel view (for large screens) to allow for sidenotes.</description>

      <description>We both recently attended useR!2017 in Brussels. It was a blast to say the least. We‚Äôre going to tag team to cover our favorite things &amp;amp; the lessons we learned while adventuring across the Atlantic.
Location Lucy: Brussels was incredible. The üç∫ was delectable and the people were delightful. ‚äïThis proved to be particularly useful when we temporarly misplaced our travel buddy Jacquelyn on our way from the ‚úàÔ∏è - we convinently followed the signs to wifi!</description>

      <description>I had such a delightful time at rOpenSci‚Äôs unconference last week. ‚äï21 üì¶ were produced! Not only was it extremely productive, but in between the crazy productivity was some epic community building.
Stefanie kicked the conference off with ice breakers, where we explored topics ranging from #rcatladies &amp;amp; #rdogfellas ‚äïfor the record, I‚Äôm an #rchickenlady, IT‚ÄôS HAPPENING to impostor syndrome. It was an excellent way to get conversations starting!

      <description>I had an absolutely delightful time at ENAR this year. Lots of talk about the intersection between data science &amp;amp; statistics, diversity, and exceptional advancements in statistical methods.
&#34;By a small sample we may judge of the whole piece&#34; -- -- I loved it, but let‚Äôs see what others were saying! Check out this word cloud of the most commonly tweeted words.
This certainly sums up my experience.</description>

      <description>A New Year‚Äôs resolution for all of our models: get more flexible!
As an aside, I‚Äôm better at implementing yoga for my models than yoga for myself, most of the time I end up like this:
 Anyways, let‚Äôs make our models flexible! By flexible, we mean let‚Äôs be more intentional about fitting nonlinear parametric models.
What do you mean by nonlinear modeling By nonlinear modeling, we mean fitting parametric models with nonlinear terms.</description>
