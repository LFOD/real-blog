<p>I had an absolutely delightful time at <a href="http://www.enar.org">ENAR</a> this year. Lots of talk about the intersection between data science &amp; statistics, diversity, and <strong>exceptional</strong> advancements in statistical methods.</p>
<!-- My conference began with the [diversity workshop](https://www.enar.org/meetings/FosteringDiversity/) where we heard from my former adviser, [Dr. Melody Goodman](http://twitter.com/goodmanthebrain), about her journey to biostatistics & her work in community advocacy and health disparities, a career panel, and a graduate student panel. [Dr. Emma Benn](https://twitter.com/EKTBenn) pointed out that Miguel de Cervantes (author of Don Quixote) would have been a biostatistian in another life: -->
<!-- <span style="color:#EB6864; font-size: 20pt">"By a small sample we may judge of the whole piece" -->
<!-- </span> -->
<p>I <strong>loved</strong> it, but letâ€™s see what others were saying! Check out this word cloud of the most commonly tweeted words.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../post/2017-03-16-enar-in-words_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This certainly sums up my experience. Some of my favorites that make a big appearance:</p>
<ul>
<li>methods</li>
<li>causal inference</li>
<li>resources</li>
<li>diversity</li>
<li>data</li>
<li>learning</li>
<li>loving</li>
</ul>
<p>Since there was quite a bit of twitter action, I thought Iâ€™d do a quick tutorial in scraping twitter data in <code>R</code>.</p>
<div id="get-twitter-credentials" class="section level2">
<h2>Get twitter credentials</h2>
<p>Go <a href="https://apps.twitter.com">here</a> and create an app - this will give you a <strong>Consumer key</strong>, <strong>Consumer secret</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"> Pro Tip: be sure to enter <code>http://127.0.0.1:1410</code> as your <code>Callback URL</code>. If you get lost, there is a great tutorial on this process <a href="https://mkearney.github.io/rtweet/articles/auth.html">here</a> </span></p>
</div>
<div id="scrape-tweets" class="section level2">
<h2>Scrape tweets</h2>
<p>We will use the <code>rtweet</code> package to scrape the tweets using the <code>search_tweets</code> function.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"> My original tutorial used <code>twitteR</code>, but <a href="https://twitter.com/ma_salmon">MaÃ«lle</a> kindly pointed out that it is on the way out and <code>rtweet</code> is the better option, so itâ€™s been updated! </span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&#39;rtweet&#39;)

twitter_token &lt;- create_token(
  app = &quot;PASTE_YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE&quot;,
  consumer_key = &quot;PASTE_YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY_HERE&quot;,
  consumer_secret = &quot;PASTE_YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET_HERE&quot;)

dat &lt;- search_tweets(&#39;#ENAR2017&#39;, n = 1e4, since = &#39;2017-03-10&#39;, token = twitter_token)</code></pre>
<p>If you would like to practice with the ENAR tweet data, you can load mine in with the following code &amp; continue with the example.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>load(url(&quot;https://github.com/LFOD/real-blog/raw/master/data/enar_data.rda&quot;))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="wrangle-tweets" class="section level2">
<h2>Wrangle tweets</h2>
<p>Now we need to corral these tweets into something we can analyze. We are going to use some data-wrangling packages (<code>dplyr</code>, <code>purrr</code>ðŸ˜º, and <code>stringr</code>) as well as Julia &amp; Davidâ€™s <code>tidytext</code>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"> For more details on how to analyze text, check out their book <a href="http://tidytextmining.com">Text Mining with R</a>, the code below is modified from one of their examples. </span></p>
<p>We will then use the <code>wordcloud</code> package to display our results.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#load packages
library(&#39;dplyr&#39;)
library(&#39;purrr&#39;)
library(&#39;stringr&#39;)
library(&#39;tidytext&#39;)
library(&#39;wordcloud&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>We are going to get rid of unwanted symbols and links, split the tweets into individual words, and filter out some stop words.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#this will drop links &amp; symbols
drop_pattern &lt;- &quot;https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|http://[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;amp;|&amp;lt;|&amp;gt;|RT|https|ht&quot;
#this pattern is great for twitter, includes # and @ symbols
unnest_pattern &lt;- &quot;([^A-Za-z_\\d#@&#39;]|&#39;(?![A-Za-z_\\d#@]))&quot;

tweets &lt;- dat %&gt;% 
  filter( !grepl(&quot;#OTORRINO&quot;, text)) %&gt;% # we have one tweeter with our hashtag that wasn&#39;t at our conference
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, drop_pattern, &quot;&quot;)) %&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, 
                text, 
                token = &quot;regex&quot;, 
                pattern = unnest_pattern) %&gt;%
  filter(!(word %in% stop_words$word),
         str_detect(word, &quot;[a-z]&quot;),
         !grepl(&quot;@&quot;, word )) </code></pre>
<p>Now itâ€™s plotting time!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cols &lt;- c(brewer.pal(8,&quot;Dark2&quot;), rep(brewer.pal(8,&quot;Dark2&quot;), each = 5) ) #make some colors for our plot

tweets %&gt;%
  count(word) %&gt;%
  with(wordcloud(word, 
                 n,
                 min.freq = 5,
                 random.order = FALSE,
                 colors = cols))</code></pre>
<p>You did it! Easy as <a href="https://potpieshop.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/pi-day.jpg?w=665">Ï€</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/fBZXu9v0qjjTq/giphy.gif" />

</div>
<p>For giggles, letâ€™s try another word cloud package <a href="https://github.com/lchiffon/wordcloud2"><code>wordcloud2</code></a>. This one is interactive (but not on CRAN, you can install using <code>devtools::install_github(&quot;lchiffon/wordcloud2&quot;)</code>).</p>
<p>For a word cloud similar to the one above, we can use the <code>wordcloud2</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&#39;wordcloud2&#39;)

tweets %&gt;%
  count(word) %&gt;%
  filter(n &gt; 2) %&gt;%
  wordcloud2(size = 3, minRotation = -pi/2, maxRotation = -pi/2)</code></pre>

<p>Try the following to make an <code>R</code> shaped cloud using the <code>letterCloud</code> function!</p>
