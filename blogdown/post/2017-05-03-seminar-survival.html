<p>Today I gave the department seminar on a piece of one of my <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/LucyDAgostinoMcGowan/clarifying-and-contextualizing-sensitivity-to-unmeasured-confounders-tipping-point-analyses">dissertation topics</a>. My brilliant classmate Ryan has created an <a href="https://ryan-j-apps.shinyapps.io/seminarSurvival/">app</a> called ‚ÄúSeminar Survival‚Äù that allows audience members to ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù and ‚Äúcheck out‚Äù throughout the seminar, indicating whether they are following along. Below are the results from my talk.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(&#39;dplyr&#39;)
library(&#39;ggplot2&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>dat &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;../../data/seminar_data.csv&quot;)

dat %&gt;%
  mutate(awake = ifelse(awake == 0, -1, awake),
         attendance = cumsum(awake)) %&gt;%
         select(time, awake, attendance) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = attendance)) + 
  geom_step() + 
  ylab(&quot;cognitive attendance&quot;) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(18.5,18.75,19,19.25,19.5),
                     labels = c(&quot;1:30 pm&quot;,&quot;1:45 pm&quot;,&quot;2:00 pm&quot;,&quot;2:15 pm&quot;,&quot;2:30 pm&quot;)) +
  annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 18.8, y = 6, label = &quot;lengthy derivation&quot;, color = &quot;#EB6864&quot;) + 
  geom_segment(x = 18.82, y = 6.2, xend = 18.85, yend = 6.8, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1,&quot;cm&quot;)), color =&#39;#EB6864&#39; )</code></pre>

<p>We had a real dip right around the 1:52 mark. I had a rather lengthy derivation there that clearly lost the audience‚Äôs interest, perhaps more emojis were necessary üåª.</p>
