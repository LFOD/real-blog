<p>For today‚Äôs rendition of <em>I am curious about everything</em>, in <a href="https://twitter.com/hspter">Hilary Parker</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/rdpeng">Roger Peng‚Äôs</a> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast/episode-32-you-have-to-reinvent-the-wheel-a-few-times">Not So Standard Deviations Episode 32</a>, Roger suggested the prevalence of drunk podcasting as dramatically increased - so I thought I‚Äôd dig into it üößüë∑.</p>
<p>I pulled the iTunes API for the term <code>drunk</code> in podcasts &amp; plotted the prevalence over time. I also finally found an excuse to use <a href="https://github.com/dill/emoGG">emoGG</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&#39;dplyr&#39;)
library(&#39;ggplot2&#39;)


req &lt;- httr::GET(url = &quot;https://itunes.apple.com/search&quot;,
          query = list(
            term = &quot;drunk&quot;,
            media = &quot;podcast&quot;,
            limit = 200
          ))

itunes &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(httr::content(req))$results</code></pre>
<p>This resulted in <code>170</code> podcasts, which I grouped by month/year released.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>itunes %&gt;%
  mutate(date = as.Date(releaseDate),monyear = zoo::as.yearmon(date)) %&gt;%
  group_by(monyear) %&gt;%
  summarise(n = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(date = zoo::as.Date(monyear)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = date,y=n)) +
    scale_x_date() +
    emoGG::geom_emoji(emoji=&quot;1f37a&quot;) + 
    ylab(&quot;Number of &#39;Drunk&#39; podcasts released&quot;) +
    theme_minimal()</code></pre>

<p><strong>It looks like Roger may be onto something.</strong></p>
<p>I tried to find the number of podcasts on iTunes by month over the past couple of years to adjust for this, but to no avail. If you have that data, please <a href="https://twitter.com/LucyStats">send it my way</a>, so I can complete this very crucial analysis. In the meantime, I‚Äôll pretend it doesn‚Äôt matter: <em>While it is certainly true that the prevalence of podcasts in general has absolutely increased over this time period, I would be surprised if the increase is as dramatic as the increase in the prevalence of ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù podcasts.</em></p>
<p>Here is a little shout out to my favorite drunk podcast <a href="https://soundcloud.com/drunkmonkpodcast">Drunk Monk</a>, with the lovely Keiko Agena (Gilmore Girls‚Äô Lane herself!).</p>
<p>Cheers! üçª</p>
