I always love [discussions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13478375/is-there-any-authoritative-documentation-on-r-release-nicknames) about R release names and their origin. I have been working on this list for a while -- with the source release of "Short Summer" today, I thought it'd be a good time to post!

All of the release names are references to Peanuts strips/films. I think this is just so delightful! A few months ago, I attempted to get permission to embed the strips on our blog, but unfortunately it was denied (unless with had a limited audience with password protection `r emo::ji("woman_shrugging")`), so I've just linked to the comics -- Enjoy!
