excerpt: "A paper by Grein et al. was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine examining a cohort of patients with COVID-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir. This paper had a flaw in it's main statistical analysis. Let's learn a bit about competing risks!"

<p>A <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007016">paper by Grein et al.¬†was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine</a> examining a cohort of patients with COVID-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir. There are two things that were interesting about this paper:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>They had a very neat figure that included tons of information about their cohort</li>
<li>The primary statistical analysis was not appropriately done</li>
</ol>
<p>Check out #1 in the <a href="https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2020/05/21/survival-model-detective-1/">Part 1</a> post. This post focuses on #2, in particular it focuses on <em>competing risks</em>. This criticism was made by Stefanos Bonovas and Daniele Piovani in a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2015312?source=nejmtwitter&amp;medium=organic-social">letter to the Editor</a> a few days ago.</p>
<div id="what-is-their-question" class="section level2">
<h2>What is their question?</h2>
<p>I believe the authors are interested in telling us about <em>clinical improvement</em> in this cohort of patients taking remdesivir, in particular they want to estimate the cumulative incidence of clinical improvement by 28 days. For the purposes of their analysis ‚Äúclinical improvement‚Äù is defined as being discharged alive or having a decrease of 2 points or more in a 6-level ordinal scale of oxygen support:</p>
<ul>
<li>ECMO<br />
</li>
<li>Mechanical ventilation<br />
</li>
<li>NIPPV<br />
</li>
<li>High-flow oxygen<br />
</li>
<li>Low-flow oxygen</li>
<li>Ambient air</li>
</ul>
<p>They use a Kaplan Meier plot to show this. Let‚Äôs recreate it first.</p>

<h2>Recreate their plots</h2>
<p>I spent <a href="https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/nejm-grein-reanalysis">some time trying to recreate their analysis</a> using the data from Figure 2, and I wasn‚Äôt quite about to do it. So I‚Äôve painstakingly pulled every number from Figure 3A üòÖ</p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to map these back to Figure 2, but it seems it replicates Figure 3A pretty well. Let‚Äôs estimate the cumulative incidence at 28 days:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1-s$surv[s$time == 28]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.8405492</code></pre>
<p>Looks very similar to the 84% reported in the initial paper. Cool, what‚Äôs the problem? The idea main idea is to examine time to clinical improvement and assess at 28 days what the cumulative incidence of improvement is. The way a typical survival analysis (like the ones the authors did here) works is typically you follow a group of patients for a certain amount of time. If they have an <em>event</em> (for example in the analysis above if they <em>improve</em>) you record them as such and the time the event occured, otherwise you <em>censor</em> them and record the final time they were observed. In the figure here we have 33 patients that <em>improved</em> and 20 that were censored. Sounds fine, what‚Äôs the problem? A key assumption is that censoring should be ‚Äúnon-informative‚Äù, in other words, the patient is followed for a certain amount of time, never has the event, and then is no longer followed. Our best guess is that we <em>know</em> they didn‚Äôt have the event up until the last day we saw them, so we <em>censor</em> them on that day. Maybe they‚Äôll have the event the next day, or maybe in a year - in order for the assumptions to be appropriately met, it must be the case that patients who have been censored are just as likely to have the event as those who are still being followed in the study. Let‚Äôs pull up Figure 2 again.</p>

<p>7 of the patients in this cohort <em>died</em>. If someone <em>dies</em> we know that they are not going to <em>improve</em> later. This is not non-informative censoring!! Luckily there is a very straightforward way to deal with this in statistics - competing risks!</p>
</div>
<div id="competing-risks" class="section level2">
<h2>Competing Risks</h2>
<p>In a competing risk analysis, we can separate out the the <em>death</em> outcome from the remaining <em>censored</em> outcomes. We can then appropriately estimate the cumulative incidence of <em>improving</em>. I‚Äôve recoded the 7 deaths (guessed from Figure 2) below.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs see how the plot looks now.</p>

<p>Ok, let‚Äôs calculate the cumulative incidence now, taking death into account.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x$`1 1`$est[x$`1 1`$time == 28][2]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.734131</code></pre>
<p>The estimated cumulative incidence of clinical improvement by day 28 is 73%. Here‚Äôs an animation of the difference.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? It‚Äôs crucial that the questions we answer statistically match the ones we are posing in practice. Understanding the underlying assumptions of the models is so important!</p>

<div id="figure-3b" class="section level2">
<h2>Figure 3B</h2>
<p>It turns out <em>really</em> this is a story abotu Figure 3B. Why? Because 100% of the patients who died were on invasive oxygen support at baseline, so modeling this correctly has the largest impact on the ‚ÄúInvasive‚Äù line on this plot. Here they were examining the same outcome, stratifying by whether patient had ‚Äúinvasive‚Äù or ‚Äúnoninvasive‚Äù baseline oxygen support.</p>

<p>Now what happens if we do a competing risks model? Let‚Äôs see what that looks like now</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- cuminc(fig_3_fixed$time,

            group = fig_3_fixed$invasive,

<pre class="r"><code>ggcompetingrisks(x, 
                 conf.int = TRUE,
                 gnames = c(&quot;Noninvasive Improvement&quot;, &quot;Invasive Improvement&quot;,
                            &quot;Noninvasive Death&quot;, &quot;Invasive Death&quot;),
                 ggtheme = theme_classic(),

<p><img src="/post/2020-05-21-survival-model-detective-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We wouldn‚Äôt expect the <em>Noninvasive</em> group to change much, because only one patient in this stratum died. Let‚Äôs focus instead on just the <em>Invasive</em> group to compare how that line changes with a proper analaysis.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-05-21-survival-model-detective-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.gif" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Basically, all this is to say that a competing risk analysis would have been more approriate here. Hopefully this code-through has been helpful!</p>
