'Tis the season for white elephant / גמד וענק / Yankee swap / secret santa-ing! There are various rules for this, for our version:  

`r emo::ji("tag")` each participant receives the name of someone else to purchase a gift for  
`r emo::ji("gift")` gifts are exchanged at a party  
`r emo::ji("think")` the receiver is tasked with guessing who the gift-giver was!
 
We thought it'd be particularly fun to do it #rstats style.

## Assigning partners

We had our interested classmates sign up on a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/),`r tufte::margin_note("![](/images/2017-11-14/google-form.png)")` resulting in a Google Sheet with each participant's `name`, `email`, and `interests`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("googlesheets")
library("dplyr")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df <- gs_url("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NHbsjZVhvIxzuivXWQvDBst0oMN7ZcCjCbI8XJeXxJI/edit#gid=860103774") %>%
  gs_read()
```

We began by making a tibble that has `name` in the first column and assigned a random `partner` in the second.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(525)
dat <- tibble(
  name = df$name,
  partner = sample(df$name)
)
```

*"But what if someone was assigned to be their own partner!"* you may ask. `r tufte::margin_note("![](https://media.giphy.com/media/23WStXFJFKN44/giphy.gif)")` Have no fear! A `while` loop is here! We allow a `while` loop to iterate until every individual is assigned a partner (who isn't them!).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
while (any(dat$name == dat$partner)) {
  dat <- tibble(
    name = df$name,
    partner = sample(df$name)
  )
}
```
*This is likely not the most efficient way, but we only had 23 friends so it's* `r emo::ji("ok_hand")` -- *if you get excited about efficiency and would like to share a quicker way to do it, please do! We* `r emo::ji("heart")` *to learn!*

**Edit:** Looks like our `r emo::ji("pray")` was answered!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What if you just did sample(names) and everyone was assigned to give a give to the next person in the vector?</p>&mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/930841037626576896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This could look something like: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dat <- df %>%
  select(name) %>%
  mutate(name = sample(name)) %>%
  mutate(partner = lag(name))
dat$partner[1] <- dat$name[nrow(dat)]
```

Or like this! (Thanks to our #livefreeordichtomize partner in crime + emoji friend Romain `r emo::ji("dancing_women")`) 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Maybe tail(.,-1)</p>&mdash; Romain François (@romain_francois) <a href="https://twitter.com/romain_francois/status/930890841522102273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 


We then do a join to pull the emails and interests back in.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df_name <- df[ , c("name", "email")]
df_partner <- df[ , c("name", "interests")]
dat <- dat %>%
  left_join(df_name, c("name" = "name")) %>%
  left_join(df_partner, c("partner" = "name"))
```

## Sending the email

[Karthik](https://twitter.com/_inundata) and I had a blast at the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) unconf creating the `r emo::ji("horse")` [ponyexpress package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ponyexpress) - what a delightful chance to use it! We didn't want the secret to be spoiled (i.e. we didn't want to know who would be buying us gifts!), so we wrote a script to send an email to our classmates.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/ponyexpress")
library("ponyexpress")
```

`r tufte::margin_note("![](https://assets-auto.rbl.ms/248d7dc3241d5585d0d9feba16933a8f5352c8f3fd6fb575c246725b35128824)")`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
body <- "Dear {name},

You have been assigned to surprise <b>{partner}</b> with a happy gift! {partner} told us they have the following interests:

<b>{interests}</b>

Remember, the price limit is $20. 

<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/zhPXoVIBMtnUs/giphy.gif'> </img>

Happy white elephant-ing,
Sarah & Lucy"

our_template <- glue::glue(glitter_template)

parcel <- parcel_create(dat,
                        sender_name = "Lucy",
                        sender_email = "lucy@myemail.com",
                        subject = "Secret Santa!",
                        template = our_template)

parcel_preview(parcel)     

parcel_send(parcel)
```

This will create an email like this:

<img src = "/images/2017-11-14/email.png" width = "500"></img>

And that's it! Happy gift-ing `r emo::ji("gift")`!
