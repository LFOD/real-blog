'Tis the season for white elphant / גמד וענק / Yankee swap / secret santa-ing! There are various rules for this, for our version:  

`r emo::ji("tag")` each participant receives the name of someone else to purchase a gift for  
`r emo::ji("gift")` gifts are exchanged at a party  
`r emo::ji("think")` the receiver is tasked with guessing who the gift-giver was!
 
We thought it'd be particularly fun to do it #rstats style.

# Assigning partners

We had our classmates sign up if they were interested in a Google Form,`r tufte::margin_note("![](/images/2017-11-14/google-form.png)")` resulting in a Google Sheet with each participant's `name`, `email`, and `interests`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("googlesheets")
library("dplyr")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df <- gs_url("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NHbsjZVhvIxzuivXWQvDBst0oMN7ZcCjCbI8XJeXxJI/edit#gid=860103774") %>%
  gs_read()
```

We began by making a tibble that shuffled the `name` in the first column and assigned a random `partner` in the second.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dat <- tibble(
  name = sample(df$name),
  partner = sample(df$name)
)
```

"But what if someone was assigned to be their own partner!" you may ask. `r tufte::margin_note("![](https://media.giphy.com/media/23WStXFJFKN44/giphy.gif)")` Have no fear! A `while` loop is here! We allow a `while` loop to iterate until every individual is assigned a partner (who isn't them!).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
while (any(dat$name == dat$partner)) {
  dat <- tibble(
    name = sample(df$name),
    partner = sample(df$name)
  )
}
```

We then do a join to pull the emails back in.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df_name <- names[ , c("name", "email")]
df_partner <- names[ , c("name", "interests")]
dat <- dat %>%
  left_join(df_name, c("name" = "name")) %>%
  left_join(df_partner, c("partner" = "name"))
```

# Sending the email

[Karthik](https://twitter.com/_inundata) and I had a blast at [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) unconf creating the [ponyexpress package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ponyexpress) - what a delightful chance to use it! We didn't want the secret to be spoiled (i.e. we didn't want to know who would be buying us gifts!), so we wrote a script to send an email to our classmates.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/ponyexpress")
library("ponyexpress")
```

`r tufte::margin_note("![](https://assets-auto.rbl.ms/248d7dc3241d5585d0d9feba16933a8f5352c8f3fd6fb575c246725b35128824)")`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
body <- "Dear {name},

You have been assigned to surprise <b>{partner}</b> with a happy gift! {partner} told us they have the following interests:

<b>{interests}</b>

Remember, the price limit is $20. 

<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/zhPXoVIBMtnUs/giphy.gif'> </img>

Happy white elephant-ing,
Sarah & Lucy"

our_template <- glue::glue(glitter_template)

parcel <- parcel_create(dat,
                        sender_name = "Lucy",
                        sender_email = "lucydagostino@gmail.com",
                        subject = "Secret Santa!",
                        template = our_template)

parcel_preview(parcel)     

parcel_send(parcel)
```

This will create an email like this:

<img src = "/images/2017-11-14/email.png" width = "500"></img>

And that's it! Happy gift-ing `r emo::ji("gift")`!
