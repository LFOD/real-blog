excerpt: "I had such a delightful time at rOpenSci's unconference. Not only was it extremely productive (21 packages were produced!), but in between the crazy productivity was some epic community building."
---

`r tufte::newthought("I had *such* a delightful time")` at rOpenSci's [unconference](http://unconf17.ropensci.org) last week. 
`r tufte::margin_note(paste("21", emo::ji("package"), "were produced!"))`
Not only was it [extremely productive](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/runconf17-projects/), but in between the crazy productivity was some epic community building.

[Stefanie](https://twitter.com/StefanieButland) kicked the conference off with ice breakers, where we explored topics ranging from #rcatladies & #rdogfellas `r tufte::margin_note("for the record, I'm an #rchickenlady, [IT'S HAPPENING](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RChickenLadies&src=typd)")` to impostor syndrome. It was an excellent way to get conversations starting!

## work
`r tufte::newthought("[Karthik](https://twitter.com/_inundata) and I worked on")` two packages:

[arresteddev](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/arresteddev): a package for when your development is going awry! `r tufte::margin_note("Mostly, this was a good excuse to look up Arrested Development gifs, which, we established, is pronounced with a g like giraffe.")` Includes functions such as `lmgtfy()`, that will seamlessly google your last error message, [David Robinson's](https://twitter.com/drob) `tracestack()` that will query your last error message on Stack Overflow, and `squirell()`, a function that will randomly send you to a distracting website - for when things are really going poorly `r emo::ji("tipping_hand_woman")`. 

[ponyexpress](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ponyexpress): a package for automating speedy emails from R - copy and paste neigh more `r emo::ji("horse")`. `r tufte::margin_note("Great for conferences, birthday parties, or karaoke invitations.")` This package allows you to send templated emails to a list of contacts. 

## play
`r tufte::newthought("Between our package building")`, there were SO many opportunities to get to know some of the most talented people.

More than anything, this was an excellent opportunity to feel like a part of a community -- and a community that certainly extends beyond the people that attended the unconference! There were so many people following along, tweeting along, and assisting along the way.



a few highlights: 

* `r emo::ji("ice_cream")` ice cream outings
* `r emo::ji("microphone")` karaoke adventures  
* `r emo::ji("cocktail")` happy hours (complete with [R-themed drinks](https://twitter.com/revodavid/status/867901254466506752))
* `r emo::ji("tongue"); emo::ji("muscle")` Karthik attempting to [lick his elbow](https://twitter.com/kara_woo/status/868353913296044032)

## analysis 

`r tufte::newthought("In an effort to stay on brand")`, I decided to do a small analysis of the tweets that came out of #runconf17. I designed a small study:

* pulled all tweets (excluding retweets) using the hashtag #runconf17 between May 24th and May 30th
* also pulled all tweets (excluding retweets) using the hashtag #rstats during the same time period

<span style="color:#EB6864">
**Question**: Are twitter users to used the #runconf17 hashtag more likely to use emojis than those who only tweeted with the #rstats hashtag during the same time period?
</span>


`r tufte::margin_note("I used the **rtweet** package to pull the tweets, **dplyr** and **fuzzyjoin** to wrangle the data a bit, and **rms** to analyze it.")`

```{r, message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
library("rtweet")
library("dplyr")
library("fuzzyjoin")
library("rms")
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
runconf <- search_tweets(q = "#runconf17 AND since:2017-05-23 AND until:2017-05-31",
                         n = 1e4, 
                         include_rts = FALSE)

rstats <- search_tweets(q = "#rstats AND since:2017-05-23 AND until:2017-05-31",
                        n = 1e4,
                        include_rts = FALSE)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
save(runconf, file = "runconf.rda")
save(rstats, file = "rstats.rda")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load("../../static/data/runconf.rda")
load("../../static/data/rstats.rda")
```

`r tufte::newthought("After pulling in the tweets")`, I categorized tweeters as either using the #runconf17 hashtag during the week or not. I then merged the tweets with an emoji dictionary `r tufte::margin_note("The emoji dictionary was discoved by the lovely [Maëlle](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon)!")`, and grouped by tweeter. If the tweeter used an emoji at any point during the week, they were categorized as an emoji-user, if not, they were sad (jk, there is room for all here!).

```{r}
## create variable for whether tweeted about runconf
runconf$runconf <- "yes"

rstats <- rstats %>%
  mutate(runconf = ifelse(screen_name %in% runconf$screen_name, "yes", "no"))

## load in the emoji dictionary
dico <- readr::read_csv2("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/today-is-a-good-day/emojis/master/emDict.csv")

## combine datasets, keep only unique tweets
data <- bind_rows(runconf, rstats) %>%
  distinct(text, .keep_all = TRUE)

## summarize by user, did they tweet about runconf in the past week 
## & did they use an emoji in the past week?
used_emoji <- regex_left_join(data, dico, by = c(text = "Native")) %>%
  select(screen_name, 
         text,
         runconf,
         emoji = Native) %>%
  group_by(screen_name) %>%
  mutate(tot_emoji = sum(!is.na(emoji)),
         used_emoji = ifelse(tot_emoji > 0, "yes", "no"),
         tot_tweets = n_distinct(text)) %>%
  distinct(screen_name, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

## results
`r tufte::newthought("We had 526 tweeters")` that just used the #rstats hashtag, and 107 that tweeted with the #runconf17 hashtag. `r tufte::margin_note(paste("THESE ARE MY PEOPLE", emo::ji("raised_hands")))` Among the #rstats tweeters, 5.9% used at least one emoji in their tweets, whereas among #runconf17 tweeters, 25.2% used emojis! 

```{r}
used_emoji %>%
  group_by(`tweeted #runconf` = runconf, `used emoji` = used_emoji) %>%
  tally() %>%
  mutate(`%` = 100*prop.table(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```


`r tufte::newthought("Alright, that looks pretty promising")`, but let's get some confidence intervals. It's time to model it! `r emo::ji("dancer")`  


```{r}
## modeling time!
dd <- datadist(used_emoji)
options(datadist = "dd")

lrm(used_emoji~runconf, data = used_emoji) %>%
  summary() %>%
  html()
```

<span style="color:#EB6864">
**Tweeting the #runconf17 hashtag seems undeniably associated with a higher odds of emoji use (OR: 5.4, 95% CI: 3.1, 9.5).**
</span>

## most popular emojis

`r tufte::newthought("Now let's checkout")` which emojis were most popular among #runconf17 tweeters. This time I'll allow for retweets `r emo::ji("dancing_women")`

`r tufte::margin_note("For this I used ggplot2, magick, and  [webshot](https://github.com/wch/webshot).")`
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("webshot")
library("magick")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
runconf_emojis <- search_tweets(q = "#runconf17 AND since:2017-05-23 AND until:2017-05-31",
                                n = 1e4)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
save(runconf_emojis, file = "runconf_emojis.rda")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load("../../static/data/runconf_emojis.rda")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
emojis <- regex_left_join(runconf_emojis, dico, by = c(text = "Native")) %>%
  group_by(Native) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Native)) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head(15) %>%
  mutate(num = 1:15)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
base <- "file:///Users/LucyMcGowan/Documents/wonderland/live-free-or-dichotomize/static/images/emojis/"

plot_emojis <- function(limit) {
  emojis_filter <- emojis %>%
    filter(emojis$n <= limit)
  out_svg <- paste0(base,"emojis_", limit,".svg")
  out_png <- paste0("../../static/images/emojis/emojis_", limit, ".png")
  p <- ggplot(emojis_filter, aes(num, n)) + 
    geom_col() + 
    xlim(c(0,16)) +
    geom_text(aes(x = num, 
                  y = n + 1,
                  label = Native), size = 5)  +
    theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(),
          axis.ticks=element_blank(),
          legend.position="none") + 
    ylim(c(0, max(emojis$n) + 10)) +
    xlab("emoji") + 
    ggtitle("#runconf17 emojis") +
    coord_flip() 
  print(p)
  gridSVG::grid.export(out_svg)
  webshot(out_svg,
          out_png,
          vwidth = 100,
          vheight = 100,
          zoom = 3)
  out_png
}

out_png <- purrr::map_chr(emojis$n, plot_emojis)

purrr::map(rev(out_png), image_read) %>%
  image_join() %>%
  image_animate(fps=1) %>%
  image_write("../../static/images/runconf_emojis.gif")
```

This (like many things I do) was very much inspired by Maëlle's [post](http://www.masalmon.eu/2017/02/18/complot/).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot_emojis <- function(limit) {
  emojis_filter <- emojis %>%
    filter(emojis$n <= limit)
  out_svg <- paste0("file://emojis_", limit,".svg")
  out_png <- paste0("emojis_", limit, ".png")
  p <- ggplot(emojis_filter, aes(num, n)) + 
    geom_col() + 
    xlim(c(0,16)) +
    geom_text(aes(x = num, 
                  y = n + 1,
                  label = Native), size = 5)  +
    theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(),
          axis.ticks=element_blank(),
          legend.position="none") + 
    ylim(c(0, max(emojis$n) + 10)) +
    xlab("emoji") + 
    ggtitle("#runconf17 emojis") +
    coord_flip() 
  print(p)
  gridSVG::grid.export(out_svg)
  webshot(out_svg,
          out_png,
          vwidth = 100,
          vheight = 100,
          zoom = 3)
  out_png
}
```

Now let's make them into a gif!
```{r, eval = FALSE}
out_png <- purrr::map_chr(emojis$n, plot_emojis)

purrr::map(rev(out_png), image_read) %>%
  image_join() %>%
  image_animate(fps=1) %>%
  image_write("runconf_emojis.gif")
```

The purple heart seems to be the most popular emoji, which makes sense given [25% of us were #RLadies](https://twitter.com/nistara_r/status/867974699044687872)! 

All in all, it was an epic experience. Thank you so much to the conference organizers, attendees, and #runconf17 tweeters for such a delightful week!
