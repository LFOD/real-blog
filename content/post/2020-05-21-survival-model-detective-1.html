<p>A <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007016">paper by Grein et al.Â was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine</a> examining a cohort of patients with COVID-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir. There are two things that were interesting about this paper:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>They had a very neat figure that included tons of information about their cohort</li>
<li>The primary statistical analysis was not appropriately done</li>
</ol>
<p>This post focuses on the very neat figure!</p>
<div id="figure-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Figure 2</h2>
<p>Figure 2 in the original paper shows the changes in oxygen-support status from baseline for each of the 53 patients. This figure includes information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The duration of follow up for each individual patient</li>
<li>Each patientâ€™s oxygen trajectory</li>
<li>Each patientâ€™s ultimate outcome (death, discharged, censored)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can construct a whole dataset from this (and I did!) - you can find it <a href="https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/nejm-grein-reanalysis">on my GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I definitely applaud the authors for making this so accessible! Check out <a href="https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2020/05/22/survival-model-detective-2/">Part 2</a> to see a bit about how their statistics could be improved.</p>
