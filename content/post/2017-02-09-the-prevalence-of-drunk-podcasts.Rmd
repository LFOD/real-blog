title: "The Prevalence of Drunk Podcasts"
excerpt: "This was inspired by Hilary Parker & Roger Peng's Not So Standard Deviations Episode 32. It was suggested the prevalence of drunk podcasting as dramatically increased - curiosity strikes again!"

This was inspired by [Hilary Parker](https://twitter.com/hspter) & [Roger Peng's](https://twitter.com/rdpeng) [Not So Standard Deviations Episode 32](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast/episode-32-you-have-to-reinvent-the-wheel-a-few-times). It was suggested the prevalence of drunk podcasting as dramatically increased - curiosity strikes again!

I pulled the iTunes API for the term `drunk` in podcasts & plotted the prevalence over time. I also finally found an excuse to use [emoGG](https://github.com/dill/emoGG).

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library('dplyr')
library('ggplot2')


req <- httr::GET(url = "https://itunes.apple.com/search",
          query = list(
            term = "drunk",
            media = "podcast",
            limit = 200
          ))

itunes <- jsonlite::fromJSON(httr::content(req))$results

itunes %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(releaseDate),monyear = zoo::as.yearmon(date)) %>%
  group_by(monyear) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(date = zoo::as.Date(monyear)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date,y=n)) +
    scale_x_date() +
    emoGG::geom_emoji(emoji="1f37a") + 
    ylab("Number of 'Drunk' podcasts released") +
    theme_minimal()
```


**It looks like Roger may be onto something.**

I tried to find the number of podcasts on iTunes by month over the past couple of years to adjust for this, but to no avail. If you have that data, please [send it my way](https://twitter.com/LucyStats), so I can complete this very crucial analysis. In the meantime, I'll pretend it doesn't matter: *While it is certainly true that the prevalence of podcasts in general has absolutely increased over this time period, I would be surprised if the increase is as dramatic as the increase in the prevalence of "drunk" podcasts.*

Here is a little shout out to my favorite drunk podcast [Drunk Monk](https://soundcloud.com/drunkmonkpodcast), with the lovely Keiko Agena (Gilmore Girls' Lane herself!).

Cheers! üçª
