<p>It’s that post-holiday time of year to write some thank yous! I’m getting excited to attend rstudio::conf next week, so in that spirit, I have put together a little thank you using <code>dplyr</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;dplyr&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>dear &lt;-function(input, you = &quot;you&quot;) {
  cat(input, &quot;\nDear &quot;, you, &quot;,&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;)
}

thank_you &lt;- function(input, for_the = &quot;gift&quot;) {
  cat(input, &quot;\n Thank you for the&quot;, for_the)
}

personal_touch &lt;- function(input, from_the_heart = &quot;I hope you have a lovely New Year!&quot;) {
  cat(input, from_the_heart)
}

from &lt;- function(input, us = &quot;us&quot;){
  cat(input, &quot;\n Cheers,\n&quot;, us)
}</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>&quot;A dplyr Thank You Note&quot; %&gt;%
  dear(you = &quot;R Studio&quot;) %&gt;%
  thank_you(for_the = &quot;opportunity to attend rstudio::conf.&quot;) %&gt;%
  personal_touch(from_the_heart = &quot;We are SO looking forward to learning from and with you all.&quot;) %&gt;%
  from(us = &quot;Lucy, Jacquelyn, and Alli&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## A dplyr Thank You Note
## Dear R Studio, 
##  Thank you for the opportunity to attend rstudio::conf. We are SO looking forward to learning from and with you all. 
##  Cheers,
##  Lucy, Jacquelyn, and Alli</code></pre>
