A recent paper, [Redefine Statistical Significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0189-z) by 72 (`r emo::ji("scream")`) co-authors, has caused quite a stir in the statistical community. Our student-run journal club at Vanderbilt will be discussing this contribution at our meeting led by [Nathan James](https://twitter.com/nalhsyjones) this week, so I've attempted to create a list of significant responses/commentary that have come out since this paper was posted on PsyArXiv.

* [Justify Your Alpha: A Response to "Redefine Statistical Significance"](https://psyarxiv.com/9s3y6): Response posted to PsyArXiv by 88 (`r emo::ji("scream")``r emo::ji("scream")`) researchers suggesting that researchers ought to select and justify P-value thresholds prior to collecting any data.

* ['One-size-fits-all’ threshold for P values under fire](http://www.nature.com/news/one-size-fits-all-threshold-for-p-values-under-fire-1.22625): Nature News article summarizing the original paper and the "Justify your Alpha" response; includes results from a poll of Nature readers "Should the P-value threshold be lowered."

*For what it's worth, others have found opposing results in a different population:*
