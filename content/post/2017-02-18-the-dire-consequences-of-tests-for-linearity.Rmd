This is a tale of the dire **type 1 error** consequences that occur when you test for linearity.

First, my favorite explanation of **type 1 error** üê∫:

We generally fix (or claim to fix) this **type 1 error** at 0.05, but sometimes our procedures can make this go awry!

I've prepared a **very** basic simulation. 

* generate 100 data points from two independent random normal distributions, an outcome $y$ and a predictor $x$<span style = "color:#EB6864"> (Since these are generated randomly, we would **not** expect there to be an association between $x$ and $y$. If all goes as planned, our **type 1 error** would be 0.05) </span>
* fit simple linear model with a restricted cubic spline on the predictor $x$
* test whether the nonlinear terms are significant
  * if they are, leave them in and test the association between $x$ and $y$
  * if they are not, remove them and refit the model with only a linear term for $x$ & proceed to test the association between $x$ and $y$.  
* calculate the **type 1 error**, how many times we detected a spurious significant association between $x$ and $y$.

Here's my simulation code (run it yourself!):

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library('rms')

sim <- function(wrong = TRUE){
#generate completely random data
y <- rnorm(100)
x <- rnorm(100)
#fit a model with a restricted cubic spline
mod <- ols(y ~ rcs(x))

if (wrong == TRUE & anova(mod)[3, 5] > 0.05){
  #if the test for non-linearity is not "significant", remove nonlinear terms
  mod <- ols(y ~ x)
} 
 #save the p-value
 anova(mod)[1, 5]
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(1) 
```

```{r wrong, cache = TRUE}
test <- replicate(10000, sim()) 
cat("The type 1 error is", mean(test <= 0.05)) 
```

Uh oh! That **type 1 error** is certainly higher than the nominal 0.05 we claim!

We would expect the **type 1 error** to be 0.05 -- I perform the same simulation omitting the step of removing non-significant nonlinear terms and calculate the **type 1 error** again.

```{r right, cache = TRUE}
test <- replicate(10000, sim(wrong = FALSE))
cat("The type 1 error is", mean(test <= 0.05))
```
Much better üëØ

The conclusion: [fit flexible models](http://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/01/27/yoga-for-modeling/) - skip the tests for linearity!
