<p>Hilary Parker &amp; Roger Peng mention a cool tactic for categorizing data on their podcast, <a href="http://nssdeviations.com">Not So Standard Deviations</a>. (If I recall correctly, I think Hilary mentioned it first, then Roger used it in a subsequent episode, unfortunately I don’t remember which episodes these were and a quick look-back proved futile. If I figure it out, I’ll link it here!)</p>
<p>The basic concept is to make a small table &amp; join it into the data frame you are trying to categorize instead of writing a bunch of if/else statements. This is especially useful if you are:</p>
<p>☝️ Using the same categories on a bunch of different data frames (you can just create the small table of categories once!)<br />
✌️ Creating multiple <em>new</em> variables from a single variable</p>

<p>I tweeted about this kernel of wisdom and a few people asked me to write up an example, so here it is!</p>
<div id="example" class="section level2">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>For this example, I am going to rank Harry Potter characters based on the house they were sorted into on a variety of characteristics.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">This data originated from a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gulsahdemiryurek/harry-potter-dataset">Kaggle Dataset by Gulsah Demiryurek</a></span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
harry_potter &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LFOD/real-blog/master/static/data/harry-potter.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<!-- ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- d <- read_delim("~/Downloads/Characters.csv", delim = ";") -->
<!-- set.seed(1) -->
<!-- d <- d %>% -->
<!--   filter(House %in% c("Gryffindor", "Ravenclaw", "Hufflepuff", "Slytherin")) %>% -->
<!--   select(Name, House) %>% -->
<!--   mutate(Name = ifelse(grepl("Lee Jordan", Name), "Lee Jordan", Name)) -->
<!-- d <- d[sample(nrow(d)),] -->
<!-- write_csv(d, "../../static/data/harry-potter.csv") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<p>Here is how I would do this with <code>case_when()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>harry_potter %&gt;%
  mutate(
    smart_rank = case_when(
      House == &quot;Ravenclaw&quot; ~ 1,

      House == &quot;Slytherin&quot; ~ 3,
      House == &quot;Hufflepuff&quot; ~ 4
    ),
    brave_rank = case_when(
      House == &quot;Gryffindor&quot; ~ 1,
      House == &quot;Slytherin&quot; ~ 2,
      House == &quot;Ravenclaw&quot; ~ 3,
      House == &quot;Hufflepuff&quot; ~ 4

    cunning_rank = case_when(
      House == &quot;Slytherin&quot; ~ 1,
