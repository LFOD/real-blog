excerpt: "For a long time I was confused by MCMC. I didn't understand how it worked, I didn't understand why we needed to do it, and mostly I didn't understand how to know if it was working. In this post I attempt to clear up those questions and allow you to watch the metroplis haystings algorithm attempt to find a posterior to help solve a problem of two birds eating seeds."
