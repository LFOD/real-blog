<p>In SNL‚Äôs cold open last night, ‚ÄúPresident Joe Biden‚Äù suggested that the COVID-19 surge we are seeing in the US is due to people seeing Spider-Man: No Way Home. If people would just stop seeing this film, he argues, cases will go back down! Interesting hypothesis, let‚Äôs take a looksy at the data, shall we?</p>

<p>I pulled the domestic box office data from <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/custom-comparisons/Spider-Man-No-Way-Home-(2021)#tab=day_by_day_comparison">the-numbers.com</a> and put them in <code>spiderman.csv</code> (if you want to code along, you can do the same! My .csv has two columns: <code>date</code> and <code>domestic_box_office</code>) and US COVID-19 cases from the <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">NY Times GitHub repository</a>. Here‚Äôs a little code-along.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

spiderman &lt;- read_csv(&quot;spiderman.csv&quot;,
                      col_types = cols(
                        date = col_date(format = &quot;%m/%d/%y&quot;),
                        domestic_box_office = col_double()
                      ))
cases &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/raw/master/us.csv&quot;)

# get daily cases from cumulative cases
cases &lt;- cases %&gt;%
  mutate(case = c(cases[1], diff(cases)))

d &lt;- spiderman %&gt;%
  left_join(cases)</code></pre>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs look at the relationship between daily domestic box office and new COVID-19 cases in the US.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">
Warning: The following is a very silly analysis. It is a joke. Please do not try at home!
</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>lm(case ~ domestic_box_office, data = d)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = case ~ domestic_box_office, data = d)
## 
## Coefficients:
##         (Intercept)  domestic_box_office  
##           3.559e+05           -3.691e-03</code></pre>
<p>Oh my heavens! Not only does it not look like ticket sales for Spider-Man: No Way Home are increasing COVID-19 cases‚Ä¶it looks like the <em>opposite</em>. According to our very silly model, every $1,000 dollar increase in domestic box office sales results in a <em>decrease</em> of 3-4 COVID-19 cases! Pandemic solved! We just need to buy more Spider-Man: No Way Home tickets!! Since we‚Äôre looking at a silly analysis, let‚Äôs do something horrible, shall we? A double y-axis!</p>

<p>The actual SNL sketch claimed there was a one week lag ‚Äì that Spider-Man sales a week ago caused cases 7 days later. Let‚Äôs check that too!</p>

<p>Well there you have it. It looks like SNL was onto something, but got it backwards! Just kidding. Let‚Äôs talk about how we can think about this from a <em>causal</em> perspective. There are lots of ways to introduce causal thinking; in my class, one of the first ways I like to get my students thinking about causal assumptions is via Hill‚Äôs Criteria. These are 9 things to think about when trying to assess whether an association is causal; it is not meant to be a checklist (and the list is not exhaustive!) but I find it is a nice way to dip your toe into causal thinking.</p>
<div id="strength" class="section level2">
<h2>Strength</h2>
<p>The first criteria is what is the <em>strength</em> of the association. Our goofy linear model suggested that 16% of the variability in the number of daily cases in the US could be explained by the Spider-Man: No Way Home domestic box office. Is this strong? The coefficient in our linear model suggests that every $1,000 dollar increase in domestic box office sales results in a <em>decrease</em> of 3-4 COVID-19 cases! That sounds pretty strong? I‚Äôm not sure this criteria is helping me assess whether this relationship is causal so I‚Äôm going to move on to the next one and rate strength as ü§∑.</p>
</div>
<div id="consistency" class="section level2">
<h2>Consistency</h2>
<p>Have other studies shown a similar association? I‚Äôm going to say no‚Ä¶consistency is going to get rated as üëé.</p>
</div>
<div id="specificity" class="section level2">
<h2>Specificity</h2>
<p>Specificity means the exposure of interest (in this case Spider-Man domestic box office) only causes one thing (and that thing is COVID-19 cases in this case). I‚Äôm going to go with no again. üëé.</p>
</div>
<div id="temporality" class="section level2">
<h2>Temporality</h2>
<p>Does the cause precede the effect? Kind of? It looks like sales are decreasing rapidly from Dec 7th through Dec 20 and cases appear to dramatically increase thereafter? But wait! Could the opposite be true? What if the surge in COVID-19 cases is causing a decrease in box office sales? (Acutally there may be some merit to this, but also we can just look at box office trends and see that they tend to decrease over time since lots of excited people go the first weekend and fewer as time goes on but I DIGRESS!) I‚Äôm going to give this a ü§∑.</p>
</div>
<div id="biological-gradient" class="section level2">
<h2>Biological gradient</h2>
<p>Do we see a dose effect? Indeed we do! As domestic box office decreases, COVID-19 cases increase, so can we infer the opposite, if domestic box office sales were to increase, would we see <em>fewer</em> COVID-19 cases? From our little window of data it looks like we can‚Äôt know (but reality check, if we had started the analysis from the day before, we actually have box office going from 0 to $121,964,712 and we don‚Äôt see a precipitous drop in COVID-19 cases, so I‚Äôm going to give this one a üëé).</p>
</div>
<div id="plausibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Plausibility</h2>
<p>Is this plausible? No, it‚Äôs silly. üëé</p>
</div>
<div id="coherence" class="section level2">
<h2>Coherence</h2>
<p>Is there a coherent argument to be made? Again, no. üëé</p>
</div>
<div id="experiment" class="section level2">
<h2>Experiment</h2>
<p>Was there a randomized trial // some attempt at estimating a causal effect to explore this relationship? Nope. üëé</p>
</div>
<div id="analogy" class="section level2">
<h2>Analogy</h2>
<p>Is there strong evidence for a similar exposure (something like Spider-Man box office sales) to cause a similar outcome (COVID-19 cases in the US)? Nope. üëé</p>
<p>Ok, so using these criteria, let‚Äôs assess the overall likelihood of a causal effect:</p>
<p><strong>Strength</strong> ü§∑<br />
<strong>Consistency</strong> üëé<br />
<strong>Specificity</strong> üëé<br />
<strong>Temporality</strong> ü§∑<br />
<strong>Biological gradient</strong> üëé<br />
<strong>Plausibility</strong> üëé<br />
<strong>Coherence</strong> üëé<br />
<strong>Experiment</strong> üëé<br />
<strong>Analogy</strong> üëé</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to go ahead and rate this one üëé not likely causal!</p>
</div>
