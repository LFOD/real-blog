<p>The prevalence of a disease plays an important role in your probability of having it given you test positive.</p>
<p>This is less relevant for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 <strong>infection</strong> since RT-PCR rarely (if ever) has false positives. However, this may be relevant for antibody tests, which are less precise. Here is a quick explainer for how this works.</p>

<p>The numbers in this explainer are made up. Are some real numbers for the sensitivity and specificity (as it stands today):

<p>RT-PCR:<br />
ðŸ‘‰ sensitivity: can be as low as 70%, maybe closer to 90%Â¹<br />
ðŸ‘‰ specificity: ~100%Â²</p>
<p>Antibody test (depends on the test, the one approved in USÂ³):<br />
ðŸ‘‰ sensitivity: 93.8%<br />
ðŸ‘‰ specificity: 95.6%</p>
