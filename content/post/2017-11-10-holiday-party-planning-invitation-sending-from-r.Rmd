'Tis the season for white elphant / גמד וענק / Yankee swap / secret santa-ing! There are various rules for this, for our version:
`r emo::ji("tag")` each participant receives the name of someone else to purchase a gift for
`r emo::ji("gift")` gifts are exchanged at a party `r emo::ji("tada")`
`r emo::ji("think")` the receiver is tasked with guessing who the gift-giver was!
 
We thought it'd be particularly fun to do it #rstats style.

# Assigning partners

We had our classmates sign up if they were interested in a Google Form.

`r tufte::margin_note("![](images/2017-11-10/google-form.png)")`

resulting in a .csv file with each participant's `name` and `email`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
names <- read_csv("FunPeople.csv")
```

We began by making a tibble that shuffled the `name` in the first column and assigned a random `partner` in the second.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dat <- tibble(
  name = sample(names$name),
  partner = sample(names$name)
)
```

"But what if someone was assigned to be their own partner!" you may ask. Have no fear! A `while` loop is here! We allow a `while` loop to iterate until every individual is assigned a partner (who isn't them!).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
while (any(dat$name == dat$partner)) {
  dat <- tibble(
    name = sample(names$name),
    partner = sample(names$name)
  )
}
```

We then do a join to pull the emails back in.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dat <- left_join(dat, names)
```

# Sending the email

[Karthik](https://twitter.com/_inundata) and I had a blast at ropensci unconf creating the [ponyexpress package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ponyexpress) - what a delightful chance to use it! We didn't want the secret to be spoiled (i.e. we didn't want to know who would be buying us gifts!), so we wrote a script to send an email to our classmates.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/ponyexpress")

library("ponyexpress")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
body <- "Dear {name},

You have been assigned to surprise {partner} with a happy gift! {partner} told us they have the following interests: {interests}. Remember, the price limit is $20. 

Happy white elephant-ing,
Sarah & Lucy"

                        subject = "Secret Santa!",
                        template = our_template)
