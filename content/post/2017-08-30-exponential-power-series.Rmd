I am a big fan of the Poisson distribution, so much in fact I even have it tatooed on my arm.

Another thing I am a big fan of the book I am currently reading: [Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman](https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041/). In a recent chapter Dr. Feynman discusses his like of the power series expansion of $e^x$, and how efficient it is. Naturally I agreed with him, because this same power series expansion is the formula from which the poisson distribution is derived. Let's show this real quick: 

First we start with the power series:

$$e^{\lambda} = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda ^ n}{n!} = 1/1 + \lambda/1 + \lambda^2 / 2 + ...$$

We see the first term is always 1 (which interestingly is a way to reason that something raised to the 0 power is 1) and then we get nice little terms that change in size by a nice pattern. To get the $i^{th}$ step we simply take the $(j - 1)^{th}$ step and multiply it by $\lambda$ and divide it by $j$. It's quite beautiful in its simplicity. By carrying out an infinite number of times our sum will converge to the true value of $e^{\lambda}$, and rather rapidly at that. 

In order to demonstrate this I have put together a small little interactive that allows you to fiddle with the exponent for $e^{\lambda}$ and the number of times you carry out this sum operation and see how well the series approximates the true value. `r tufte::margin_note('Note that as you increase the exponent the number of steps you need to get a good estimate increases with it, why might this be?')`

The bar plot shows the size of each step, aka how big is $\lambda^i/i!$, above this is the sum of all of the bars, aka the series estimate of $e^{\lambda}$ at the number of steps you have specified.
